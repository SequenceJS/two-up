# Two Up - Sequence.js Theme

> A full-screen, two column layout for showing a featured image and description. As the user navigates content slides in from the bottom and the featured image sweeps in over the top of the previous one.

This theme is powered by [Sequence.js](http://sequencejs.com/) - The responsive CSS animation framework for creating unique sliders, presentations, banners, and other step-based applications.

## Getting Started

To add a Sequence.js theme to your web page, complete the following:

1. Download and unzip your theme
2. Move the `two-up` folder to the same folder as the page you'd like the Sequence.js theme to appear on
3. Add the theme's stylesheet within the `<head></head>` tags on your page, below existing stylesheets. For example:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="two-up/css/sequence-theme.two-up.css" />
```

4. From `two-up/index.html`, copy everything inside the `<body></body>` tags, then paste into the page you'd like the theme to appear on.
5. From `two-up/index.html`, copy any `<script></script>` elements found toward the bottom of the page and paste just before the closing `</body>` tag. This should include a reference to the Sequence.js library, its third-party dependencies, and the theme's options, for example:
```html
<script src="two-up/scripts/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script>
<script src="two-up/scripts/hammer.min.js"></script>
<script src="two-up/scripts/sequence.min.js"></script>
<script src="two-up/scripts/sequence-theme.two-up.js"></script>
```

6. Save your file and view in the browser. You're done!

7. *Optional*: Internet Explorer 8 will show the mobile layout regardless of browser width. If you'd like to fix that, add a reference to [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) after all references to CSS. This will add media query support to older browsers. For example:

  ```javascript
  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="two-up/scripts/respond.min.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->
  ```
8. *Optional*: In addition to step 7, for Internet Explorer 8 support, please add a reference to a stylesheet specific to that browser, like so:

  ```html
  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <link href="css/sequence-theme.two-up-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all">
  <![endif]-->
  ```

### Customizing a Theme

To customize how a theme behaves, its Sequence.js options can be changed in `two-up/scripts/sequence-theme.two-up.js`. See Options in the [documentation](http://www.sequencejs.com/documentation/#options).

To customize how a theme looks and how its step's transition, refer to the theme's stylesheet: `two-up/css/sequence-theme.two-up.css`.

It is recommended to read [Setting Up a Theme](http://www.sequencejs.com/documentation/#setting-up-a-theme) in the documentation for an overview of how transitions are applied to Sequence.js steps.

## Using Grunt.js to Develop a Theme

If you are familiar with Grunt.js, you can use it to automate common development tasks. This however is optional and isn't required for a theme to work.

Sequence.js and the themes it powers use [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate useful tasks. With Grunt.js installed (see Grunt.js' [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)), use the following command to install this theme's development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once development dependencies have installed you can use the commands `grunt serve` and `grunt`.

### `grunt serve`

This command will start a development environment with the following automated tasks:

- Starts a [livereload](http://livereload.com/) session that will reload your browser whenever a file is changed (be sure to install [livereload](http://livereload.com/))
- Opens your browser and navigates to `http://localhost:8000/`
- Sets up a *watch* task to run the following sub-tasks:
  - Update the version number of the following files when changed in `package.json`:
    - `scripts/sequence-theme.two-up.js`
    - `scss/sequence-theme.two-up.scss`
    - `css/sequence-theme.two-up.css`
    - `bower.json`
  - Process any `.scss` files found in the `scss` directory, autoprefix them and then copy to `css` and minify
  - Refresh the browser when any changes are made in HTML, JS, CSS, or SCSS files

You only need to run `grunt serve` per each development session as the *watch* task will continue to operate as you modify files.

### `grunt`

The `grunt` command is a manual version of the *watch* sub tasks listed for the `grunt serve` command.
